### A collection of personal tools in R  

This is a collection of tools I find myself using on a regular basis, collected in one place so that I dont' have to replicate the code with every new project. It's for personal use, but someone may find some of the tools useful on their own projects.

## Tools  
### makeVecNorm()  
### makeRoot()  
### %notin%  
An infix operator  
### no_space()  
### mutate_cond()  
A dplyr tool which selectively mutates a subset of rows which meet a condition.  
### calc_tax()  
Calculates the tax burden based on US personal income tax brackets.
